# Pico2W DualSense 5 Bridge

[中文](./README.CN.md)

> Turn a Raspberry Pi Pico2W into a wireless adapter for the DualSense (DS5) controller.

## Overview

This project enables the Raspberry Pi Pico2W to function as a Bluetooth bridge for the DualSense controller, allowing wireless connectivity with enhanced haptics support.

## Features

- 🎮 Full DualSense connectivity via Pico2W
- 🔊 Supports HD haptics (advanced vibration feedback)
- 📡 Wireless Bluetooth bridging

## Improvements

Add client mode which requires [DS5Server](https://github.com/zhh7ce/DS5Server). Encoding is performed on a Linux PC to reduce Pico workload, lower latency, and optimize audio quality. Pico W may enable audio support. Microphone functionality may be added in the future, with Opus decoding handled on the PC.

## Getting Started

### Flashing Firmware

1. Hold the BOOTSEL button on the Pico2W
2. Connect the Pico2W to your computer via USB
3. The device will mount as a USB storage device
4. Drag and drop the .uf2 firmware file onto the device

### Pairing the Controller

1. Put the DualSense controller into Bluetooth pairing mode
2. Wait for the Pico2W to detect and connect
3. Once connected, the device will appear on the host system

***You may need to replug the Pico when the controller is in pairing mode.***

## Configuration

You can modify the Pico settings via the web config.

- For release: https://ds5.awalol.eu.org
- For development: https://ds5-dev.awalol.eu.org

## Notes

The Pico device will only be visible to the system after the controller is connected

Some behaviors depend on reconnection cycles to take effect

### Low-battery LED indicator

When the connected DualSense reports its battery at or below 10% (and it is not charging), the Pico onboard LED switches from solid-on to a 1 Hz blink so you can see the warning at a glance. The LED returns to solid-on as soon as the controller is plugged in or its reported level rises again. The blink also fires when `disable_pico_led` is set — the warning is treated as critical and overrides the LED-off preference; the LED returns to its disabled (off) state once the battery recovers or the controller starts charging.

To opt out at build time, configure with `-DENABLE_BATT_LED=OFF`. Default is ON.

### Pico W Version

Pico W only has haptics support, no speaker. You can enable Pico W firmware compilation with `-DPICO_W_BUILD=ON`, or download precompiled firmware from GitHub Actions.

### USB Wake Feature

This feature is experimental. If you need this functionality, please check out the feat/usb-wake branch to compile it, or use the precompiled firmware from GitHub Actions under that branch. The `ds5-bridge-wake.uf2` is the firmware with this feature enabled.

It is recommended to read #60 and #61 before using this feature.

### Community Fork

## Known Issues

- ⚠️ Audio may experience slight stuttering
- ⚠️ Overclocking is required for proper performance

## Performance / Overclocking

Due to encoding requirements, the Pico2W must be overclocked:

Current settings:

- Voltage: 1.2V
- Frequency: 320 MHz

If your device fails to boot:

- Increase voltage slightly or Reduce CPU frequency

## Build Instructions

To build the project from source:

1. ***Update TinyUSB in the Pico SDK to the latest version***
2. Compile using standard Pico SDK toolchain
